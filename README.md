# Appetizers

Appetizers is a take-home app developed by @SAllen0400 that covers the basics of SwiftUI. It's a good project to learn how this framework works, API requests with async/await, MVVM architecture, reusable components, etc. You can watch the progress commit by commit or follow the tutorial I have left in the description of the project
